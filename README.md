# Bubble-sort
A sorting algorithm. 
#you have any list and you have to sort it in order aka [5,3,6,8] and it must work any type of data

#thinking process: you can use the len function first to find out how many indexes you have in the list.
#Then you can call one of the indexes and compare then with the next one.
#then you can loop it and if it is bigger then you swap them and if it's smaller you go onto the next index and compare them so on until all of the next indexes are bigger than the compared one.
# start at inde x 0 and compare it with 1 and so on until you reach the last index.
